- next: # unreleased
  - New:
    - Add procedures to remove duplicated strings
  - Fix:
    - Crating String from string no longer uses 0 as "At position" argument
      supporting older versions of Praat
  - Changes:
    - Simplified creation of empty Strings objects (thanks @rolandomunoz!)
- v0.0.13:
  - New:
    - Added a procedure to create Strings objects from multiline
      strings.
  - Fixes:
    - Added missing documentation for some procedures
      (eg. `@findInStrings`)
    - Added copyright information to some files
- v0.0.12:
  - New:
    - Added splice and excise to array procedures
    - Added a script to remove directory trees. Use with care!
  - Change:
    - Slice as an array procedure no longer modifies original
    - array.proc no longer provides @split. Use the one from
      utils, which now optionally supports Strings arrays
    - Updated CI script
  - Fix:
    - Minor fixes to documentation and tests
- v0.0.11:
  - New:
    - Add procedures for using Strings as pseudo-arrays
  - Change:
    - Scripts for full path Strings now keep the IDs of both relative
      and absolute lists in the `.relative` and `.absolute` variables.
    - Outsourced directory normalisation to "utils" and removed where not 
      essential
    - (Breaking) New and more systematic interface for procedures for finding,
      replacing, and extracting strings:
      - Procedures are separated into `<name>` and `<name>_regex`, to mimic
        the Praat interface
      - Finding and extracting procedures take 2 arguments: the query and
        a boolean flag for positive or negative matching
      - Replacing procedures take 3 arguents: the search query, the replacement,
        and the number of replacements, like `replace()` or `replace_regex()`
  - Fix:
    - Added a failsafe for safer empty Strings generation
    - In-code documentation updated and fixed throughout
    - Minor bug fixes and code simplifications
