- next: # unreleased
  - Change:
    - Scripts for full path Strings now keep the IDs of both relative
      and absolute lists in the `.relative` and `.absolute` variables.
    - Outsourced directory normalisation to "utils"
    - (Breaking) New and more systematic interface for procedures for finding,
      replacing, and extracting strings:
      - Procedures are separated into `<name>` and `<name>_regex`, to mimic
        the Praat interface
      - Finding and extracting procedures take 2 arguments: the query and
        a boolean flag for positive or negative matching
      - Replacing procedures take 3 arguents: the search query, the replacement,
        and the number of replacements, like `replace()` or `replace_regex()`
