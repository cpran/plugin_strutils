Description:
  Short: a collection of basic Strings utilities
  Long: >
    Pending the eventual release of arrays, Strings are the preferred way to
    work with lists of strings in Praat, including lines in text files,
    directory and file listings, and many other uses.

    However, some tasks are difficult because of the lack of some arguably
    basic features. This plugin attempts to solve this by providing commands
    and procedures to, among others, the following tasks:

    * Create empty strings
    * Sort strings generically
    * Replace strings
    * Search in strings
    * Make subsets of Strings
    * Make file listings with full paths
